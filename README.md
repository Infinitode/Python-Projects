## Setup

- Make sure that you have at least Python `3.6` or later (we recommend `3.12`) installed on your computer. You can do a quick search and download it from a trusted provider for your platform.

- Make sure that you have an IDE, or a place where you could code and run the Python interpreter.
> [!TIP]
> We use Visual Studio Code. It's fast, efficient, and has many extensions and customizability options.
